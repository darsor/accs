The accs script in this directory is an init script
which can be used to start the program at boot.

To install the script as a service:
    chmod +x accs
    cp accs /etc/init.d/accs
    update-rc.d accs defaults

The ACCS program will now start on boot.

You can use
    service accs start
    service accs stop
to start or stop the program manually.
